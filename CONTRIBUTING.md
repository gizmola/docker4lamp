# Contributing

- Contributions to the project are welcome.  Please create or reuse relevant issues, and tag your commits with Fixes #{issue number}

- Fork the project, make a branch and add your code.  When tested, make a pull request

- Please keep in mind that this project is intended to be a functional development platform for most LAMP development projects.

- The original idea was to provide an alternative to Xamp/Mamp/Wamp setups, but it is not intended to become something large and highly configurable like Devilbox or Laradock

- I want a new user to be able to modify at most a few .env settings, and issue docker-compose up and start building/coding

- I do plan to have additional helper containers like mailhog.  Even though there are great alternatives to certain helpers (adminer vs. phpMyAdmin) the project will likely remain opinionated and will pick one solution at most
